# ndxplorer

ndXplorer is an interactive tool for analyzing and visualizing multidimensional data sets. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface for data exploration, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and visualization.

## Overview

ndXplorer is designed to handle various types of multidimensional data, including:
* Multi-dimensional fluorescence (MFD) data
* Sampling of posterior distributions from [ChiSurf](https://github.com/Fluorescence-Tools/chisurf)
* Inter-label distance distributions from [Olga](https://github.com/Fluorescence-Tools/Olga)
* General multidimensional scientific data

ndxplorer can be used as a standalone application or integrated into other software as a tool.

## Features

* **Interactive Data Visualization**: Create and customize various plot types for multidimensional data
* **Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for visualizing high-dimensional data
* **Clustering Analysis**: Perform clustering using algorithms like HDBSCAN and K-means
* **Data Import/Export**: Read and write data in various formats
* **Curve Overlay**: Overlay curves on plots for comparison
* **Parameter Editing**: Interactive editing of visualization parameters
* **Code Editing**: Built-in code editor for customization
* **Customizable UI**: Flexible user interface with theme support

## Dependencies

ndXplorer requires the following dependencies:
* Python
* PyQt and QtPy (for GUI)
* tttrlib (the table: reading, writing, gating and histogramming)
* NumPy, scipy (for computation)
* matplotlib and PyQtGraph (for plotting)
* UMAP-learn (for dimensionality reduction)
* HDBSCAN and scikit-learn (for clustering)
