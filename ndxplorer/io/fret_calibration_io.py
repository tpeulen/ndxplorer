"""Save and load an accurate-FRET calibration.

A calibration is a handful of numbers — gamma, alpha, beta, delta, R0, the
backgrounds — that took a measurement and a fit to obtain. Losing them means
running the calibration again on data that may no longer be open, and typing
them into another window by hand is how a factor ends up transcribed wrong.

**The default place to keep them is the measurement itself.** A `.pto`
container already holds the photon stream, the burst table and the background
estimate; a calibration determined *from* that measurement belongs beside them,
not in a stray file next to it that a later copy will leave behind. So
:func:`save_calibration` writes into the container when the window has one, and
falls back to a JSON file only when it does not, or when the caller asks.

Both routes write the same JSON payload, so a calibration read out of a
container and one read out of a file are the same object.

The payload carries more than the numbers: the report text the calibration
printed, the uncertainties, which factors were actually written and which were
held fixed, and where it came from. A bare set of factors cannot answer "was
this gamma fitted here, or carried in from a reference sample?", and that is the
question a reader has a year later.

Both windows use this module: the Qt window through ChiSurf's ndX plugin and
the emtk app's Accurate FRET feature. A "window" here is anything with a
``data_source`` whose ``provenance`` names the container (the `.pto` reader
sets it). The container route needs ChiSurf's measurement container
(``chisurf.core.fio.pto``, as the `.pto` reader does); the file route needs
nothing.
